# Milestone 1:

### Data Interactions:
    - Users will be able to select certain variables to view graphs/charts pertaining to their selection.
        -Ex, choose to view graph that displays new cases per day over time
        -Ex, choose to view a graph that looks at how many cases there are per age group
    - Users will be able to see chart data change based on what day the have the slider on the bottom set to.
        -Ex, If they set the slider to day 10, the chart will display the active, confirmed, death, and recovery values 
        from day 10 in each county
    - Users can submit a symptoms form that will allow us to obtain more data related to the virus
    - Users will be able to create an account and sign in, users must be signed in to submit a symptoms form.
    -Future Goal: Users can see data for multiple states and have the option to jump from state to state.
    -Future Goal: The map of the state will be interactive, areas with a lot of cases will be marked darker.
