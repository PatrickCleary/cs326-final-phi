### COVID-19 Symptom Tracker
Spring 2020

### Overview:

We have created an application intended to be used to aid the attempts of tracking the COVID-19 disease. We saw that there was a lack in the ability to effectively test the population for the disease, and many tests went unreported. Our application aims to allow people to submit a form detailing symptoms they have had which they believe to be related to the novel Coronavirus, whether or not they have been officially tested. This information can be used to track milder cases and the extent of the disease. Many of the current online trackers pull their information directly from databases, and we wanted to improve on that.

### Database: 

Two tables, Users, and Symptoms. Every User object has a corresponding Symptom Object and vice versa.

User table:

 {
    __id: object ID
    username: string,
    email: string,
    password: string,
    tested: boolean,
    testedResult: integer,
    symptom: Symptom Object ID,
    sex: string,
    county: String,
    age: integer,
    date: Date
  }

  Symptoms table:
    {
        user: User object ID,
        fever: integer,
        tiredness: integer,
        chills: integer,
        digestion: integer,
        smell: integer,
        congestion: integer,
        cough: integer,
        breathing: integer,
        date: integer,
    }


### URL Routes/Mappings:
- / homepage
- /login login page
- /register sign up page
- /form form submission page (only available if logged in)

### Authentication/Authorization:

Any user can create an account and submit a symptom form. That form is private to them, and if they view the submission form after submitting it they will see their own symptoms and can update the form.
Once logged in users have options to log out, and delete their account. Those options appear in the navbar. Other than that the home page looks similar for all users authenticated or otherwise.
